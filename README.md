# nyc-taxis-and-covid-19
 MA346 Final Project

This project takes data from:
https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page

The project uses the data collected to analyze how the iconic Yellow
Taxis in Manhattan are doing during COVID-19. At the time of
completion of this project, the NYC TLC has only uploaded data
up until June of 2020. Therefore this analysis is limited to data
up until June of 2020. This analysis focuses on how total daily
passengers and trip distance is correlated to the number of cases and
deaths in Manhattan.

Important Notes:

Github does not allow committing files that are bigger than 100MB, 
so the taxi data for March is trimmed to only what we need in this 
repository. If you want all the files to run this code on your own, 
please go to https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page 
and download the Yellow Taxi Trip Records CSV for March.

Note: It is recommended that you run this code on your own by
downloading the final_code.py file and running it on your own Python
application, as deepnote has limited memory and may take much longer
than running it on your own.
